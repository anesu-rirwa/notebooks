# Welcome to my Colab Chaos!

This repo is where I document my journey from following tutorials to creating my own data science projects. 

**Expect to find:**

* **Jupyter Notebooks:** Filled with code experiments, data visualizations, and maybe even a few accidental breakthroughs. 
* **Machine Learning Models:** From simple linear regression to the wildest deep learning architectures (that sometimes actually work!).
* **Data Wrangling Adventures:** Where I wrestle with messy datasets and emerge victorious (hopefully).
* **Failed Experiments:** Because even the best scientists learn from their mistakes (and I document them for your amusement).
* **Tutorials & Reproductions:** My attempts at replicating and understanding concepts from online courses and tutorials.

**Disclaimer:** 

* There might be some questionable coding choices in here. 
* You've been warned.

**Feel free to:**

* **Explore:** Dive into the notebooks and see what I've been up to.
* **Learn:** Hopefully, you'll pick up a thing or two from my code (or at least be entertained by my struggles).
* **Fork and Modify:** Feel free to use, modify, and break my code in any way you see fit. 

**Let's learn and have fun together!**

**P.S.** If you find any bugs or have any suggestions, please don't hesitate to let me know. 

**P.P.S.** I might update this README from time to time, so check back often for new adventures!

**Cheers,**
**Anesu**
